# project-euler

This repo tracks my progress on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.

Only solutions up to and including the 100th problem will appear here (Project Euler rules).

My favourite questions so far:
+ [Problem 12](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12): Highly Divisible Triangular Number.
  + *Neat little prime number properties come in handy.*
+ [Problem 62](https://projecteuler.net/problem=62): Cubic Permutations.
  + *Honestly I'm not sure why this has a higher difficulty rating, but I found it fun and quick to solve.*
